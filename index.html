                <p class="text-muted text-left">Canada's Wonderland is a 134-hectare (330-acre) theme park located in Vaughan, Ontario, a suburb approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) north of Downtown Toronto. Opened in 1981 by the Taft Broadcasting Company and The Great-West Life Assurance Company as the first major theme park in Canada, it remains the country's largest.[3][4] The park, currently owned by Cedar Fair, has been the most visited seasonal amusement park in North America for several consecutive years.[5]

                    As a seasonal park, Canada's Wonderland is open daily from May to Labour Day, with weekend openings in late April and after Labour Day until end of October. There are special events throughout the season, including various food festivals, as well as "Celebration Canada", a month-long Canada Day festival, among others. The park holds Halloween Haunt, a Halloween-themed event, each fall until the last weekend of October at midnight. Beginning in 2019, the park launched WinterFest, a holiday-themed event that would extend the park's operating season to late December.</p>
